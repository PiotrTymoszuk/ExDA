\title{Check validity of a plotting data frame and it's variables.}
\usage{
validate_df(data, variable, split_factor, .drop = TRUE)

validate_2df(data, variable1, variable2, .drop = TRUE)

validate_multi_df(
  data,
  variables,
  split_factor = NULL,
  format = c("numeric", "factor"),
  .drop = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame.}

\item{variable}{name of the data frame's variable whose distribution will be
shown in the plot. Provided as a string.}

\item{split_factor}{name of the data frame's variable, whose categories will
be used to split values of \code{variable} in the plot. Provided as a string.}

\item{.drop}{logical, should empty levels of a factor be dropped?}

\item{variable1}{name of the data frame's variable whose distribution will be
shown in the X axis of the plot. Provided as a string.}

\item{variable2}{name of the data frame's variable whose distribution will be
shown in the Y axis of the plot. Provided as a string.}

\item{variables}{a character vector with variable names.}

\item{format}{the intended format of the variables: numeric of factor.
If there are any requested variables in the data frame incompatible with
the \code{format}, and error is raised.}
}
\value{
a data frame with columns whose names are specified by arguments
\code{variable} and \code{split_factor}, or \code{variable1} and \code{variable2}.
Numbers of observation before and after pre-processing are stored as
the \code{n_numbers} and \code{n_categories} attributes.
}
\description{
Internal functions used to validate if an object is a data frame, and whether
it has specific variables.
Used by plotting functions.
Subsequently, the object is processed by removal of \code{NA} values, and,
optionally, empty levels.
